# Tram-way-or-another
A hobby project to find out, how can I travel with all trams in Budapest in only one day. The main and the only criteria is to travel at least one station in each line in a 24 hour-long period.

In Budapest there are 26 tramlines (without B or other letter-named part lines).  I would like to start my journey in Megyeri Ãºt station, which is the final station of the tram line 14M. The first ride is starting at 4:03 AM, that's why I can start quite early morning.
